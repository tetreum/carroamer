# Car Roamer

![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tetreum/carroamer/master/preview.gif)

A game about roaming around in a car.

# Requirements
- Unity (tested version in)=> [ProjectVersion.txt](https://github.com/tetreum/carroamer/blob/master/ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt) (it should work on newer versions too, but may require changes/fixes)

# Download binary

You can download the latest compiled binary here: https://github.com/tetreum/carroamer/releases

# ToDo

- NPCs: Walking, standing, chatting.
- Dialogs: So NPCs can give you missions, hints or tell you histories.
- Missions: Deliver packages or passengers from one place to another.
- Add fuel system to vehicles.
- Add turn lights.
- Merge Sun Temple with Windridge City (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/roadways/windridge-city-132222)
- Implement [RoadArchitect](https://github.com/FritzsHero/RoadArchitect) for roads

# I want to collaborate!

Check if you can do any of the following tasks:

## Improve vehicle model
Current model (Mercedes-Benz) has some problems:
- It doesn't have trunk: For future missions it would be really useful to have it.
- Has holes on multiple places, like doors: https://github.com/tetreum/carroamer/blob/master/Screenshots/vehicleHoles.png
- Central mirror is not a single piece/it's material is duplicated: Unifying it would let me fill the area with a full mirror, rather than the actual recantgular.
- Left mirror material is homehow broken: If you replace it with the one containing the rendererTexture, only a black screen will show up.

## Improve the map design
The idea is to have a road that lets you explore interesting places if you want, or just keep driving ahead.

And also check the ToDo list.
