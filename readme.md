# I want to collaborate!

Check if you can do any of the following tasks:

## Improve vehicle model
Current model (Mercedes-Benz) has some problems:
- It doesn't have trunk: For future missions it would be really usefull to have it.
- Central mirror is not a single piece/it's material is duplicated: Unifying it would let me fill the area with a full mirror, rather than the actual recantgular.
- Left mirror material is homehow broken: If you replace it with the one containing the rendererTexture, only a black screen will show up.

## Improve the map design
The idea is to have a road that lets you explore interesting places if you want, or just keep driving ahead.

And also check the ToDo list.
